## 🚀 MVP Timeline (Current Phase)

**Phase 1: Synthetic Testing (NOW - Week 1)**
- ✅ Use only fake students (test_001, test_002, etc.)
- ✅ Use only public policies
- ✅ Test all features with safe data
- ✅ Show in API responses: `data_source.real_pii_stored = false`

**Phase 2: Pilot Colleges (Month 2)**
- 🔐 Real course data (IIT Delhi CS101)
- 🔐 Synthetic students (psud_001, psud_002) - fake names
- 🔐 Same privacy guarantees (metadata-only logging)
- 🔐 API responses will show: `data_source.type = "PILOT_REAL_COURSES"`

**Phase 3: Production (Month 3+)**
- 🔐 Real course data from multiple colleges
- 🔐 Real student logins (with consent)
- 🔐 Pseudonymous logging
- 🔐 API responses will show: `data_source.type = "PRODUCTION"`

## 📋 Data Provenance Checklist

Every API response includes this structure to show data sources:

```python
class DataProvenance:
    source_type: str  # PUBLIC_POLICY | SYNTHETIC_TEST | PILOT_REAL_COURSES | PRODUCTION
    source_name: str  # Where data came from
    real_pii_stored: bool = False  # Always false for MVP
    real_content_stored: bool = False  # Always false for MVP
    logged_fields: list = ["action", "decision", "timestamp"]  # What's logged
    retention_days: int  # How long kept (90 for test, 999999 for policy)
    privacy_summary: str = "✅ 100% Safe - No real PII, no content"
```

Every response will show:
- ✅ **Data Source**: Where the data comes from
- ✅ **PII Status**: Whether real names are stored
- ✅ **Content Status**: Whether real submissions are stored
- ✅ **Privacy Summary**: Human-readable safety statement

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**In every API response, you will CLEARLY see:**

```json
{
  "data_source": {
    "source_type": "SYNTHETIC_TEST or PUBLIC_POLICY or PILOT or PRODUCTION",
    "source_name": "Exact description of where data came from",
    "real_pii_stored": false,
    "real_content_stored": false,
    "privacy_summary": "✅ 100% Safe - No real PII, no content"
  }
}
```

**Students will see**: "✅ Your data is safe - only your decisions are logged, never your content or name"

**Faculty will see**: "✅ This policy is based on [Public University] guidelines, no real student data used"

**Admins will see**: "✅ These metrics are from course-level aggregations, no individual student data"

**Auditors will see**: "✅ Every API call shows its data sources - full transparency"
