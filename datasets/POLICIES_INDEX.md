## 🎓 How to Use in Your System

### Load Policies in Python

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load all policies
policies_dir = Path("datasets/policies_corpus/policies_parsed")
policies = {}

for policy_file in policies_dir.glob("*.json"):
    with open(policy_file) as f:
        policy = json.load(f)
        policy_id = policy["policy_id"]
        policies[policy_id] = policy

# Access specific policy
cornell = policies["CORNELL_AI_2025_v1"]

# Get all allowed uses
allowed_uses = cornell["allowed_uses"]

# Check disclosure requirements
for use in allowed_uses:
    if use["disclosure_required"]:
        print(f"{use['use_case']}: {use['disclosure_method']}")
```

### Query by Institution
```python
# Find policy by institution name
institution_name = "MIT"
mit_policy = next(p for p in policies.values() 
                  if p["institution"] == institution_name)

# Get prohibited uses
prohibited = mit_policy["prohibited_uses"]
```

### Extract Disclosure Templates
```python
# Get all disclosure formats across institutions
all_formats = []
for policy in policies.values():
    if "disclosure_requirements" in policy:
        formats = policy["disclosure_requirements"].get("formats", [])
        all_formats.extend(formats)

# Use in Q&A: "Here's how to disclose AI use according to [Institution]..."
```
